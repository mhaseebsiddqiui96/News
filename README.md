# EGYM
Coding assignment

# Architecture
I have used viper in my app for both modules

# Dependency
Havn't used any external dependencies. Initially I used sdWebImage but then I got some time so I wrote my own. Maybe that can have some minor issues but I have wrote tests for that so confident it will work well.

# Test Coverage
Used default XCTest farmework to write test cases and currently it has 84% test coverage.
